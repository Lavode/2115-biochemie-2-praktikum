\chapter{Procedure}

The listed steps are based on the provided script, with changes where we
deviated from what was written.

\section{Expression}

Expression was done by the assistants ahead of time, the corresponding steps of
the protocol are only listed for completness' sake.

\begin{itemize}
	\item From a freshly transformed plate (plasmid: pET28) of the given
		membrane protein target in BL21 pLysS strain, inoculate
		\SI{30}{\ml} LB medium containing \SI{30}{\ug \per \ml}
		kanamycin (kan) for the expression of different proteins. Leave
		shaking overnight (ON) at \SI{37}{\celsius}. This pre-culture
		volume is suitable for \SI{1.5}{\l} culture grow-up.

	\item Prepare and autoclave \SI{1.5}{\l} of LB medium overnight so that
		the medium remains warm on the next day.

	\item To each \SI{1.5}{\l} bottle, add \SI{30}{\ml} of pre-culture
		inoculum, the appropriate antibiotics and incubate in a water
		bath with a controlled temperature at \SI{37}{\celsius}. We
		used a new device called LEX48 for bacteria growing in which
		shaking is replaced by air bubbling directly in the medium.

	\item Check the OD$_{\SI{600}{\nm}}$ from time to time and induce
		expression once the latter reached \numrange{1.2}{1.5} by adding
		\SI{0.2}{\milli\Molar} of IPTG (Isopropyl
		$\beta$-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside).

	\item Harvest bacterial cells 5h after induction by spinning down at
		\SI{8000}{\rpm} for \SI{15}{\min}. Discard supernatant, wash
		the pellet once with \SI{50}{\milli\Molar} HEPES pH 7.5,
		\SI{200}{\milli\Molar} \ce{NaCl}, \SI{7.5}{\percent} glycerol
		then flash-freeze in liquid nitrogen and store at
		\SI{-80}{\celsius} for further use.
\end{itemize}

In parallel, we transformed E. coli LEMO21 (DE3) strain with the plasmid
pET28-cybB561-dsred.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Plate the cells on an LB agar plate containing kanamycin and
		chloramphenicol and incubate them overnight at \SI{37}{\celsius}
\end{itemize}

We worked with a bacterial pellet, weighing \SI{6.4}{\g}, containing the H158F
mutant of the superoxide oxidase.

\begin{itemize}
	\item A HEPES buffer according to table \ref{tbl:hepes_buffer} was
		prepared, the bacterial pellet thawed, and resuspended in
		\SI{32}{\ml} buffer. The resulting volume was roughly
		\SI{40}{\ml}.
	\item \SI{0.2}{\ml} of a \SI{0.2}{\Molar} PMSF stock was added for a
		final concentration of \SI{1}{\milli\Molar}
	\item \SI{0.8}{\ml} of a \SI{0.1}{\Molar} \ce{MgCl2} stock solution was
		added for a final concentration of \SI{2}{\milli\Molar}
	\item A tiny spatula tip DNAse, half a spoon lysozyme, and half a spoon
		PEFA-block were added.
	\item Bacterial cells were broken in the maximator at a pressure of $>$
		\SI{1000}{\bar}, three passes.
	\item The sample was centrifuged for \SI{15}{\min} at \SI{8000}{G} to
		remove unbroken cells and debris. The supernatant was
		transferred to a new tube, the pellet discarded. 
	\item The sample was centrifuged for \SI{5}{\min} at \SI{8000}{G} once
		more, the supernatant transferred to a new tube and the pellet
		discarded.
	\item The sample was ultracentrifuged for \SI{45}{\min} at $>$
		\SI{186000}{G} and \SI{4}{\celsius}. The supernatant was
		discarded.
	\item The pellet was resuspended in \SI{4}{\ml} HEPES buffer and
		homogenized.
	\item \SI{50}{\ul} of the sample were put aside for future use.
	\item Four dilutions according to table \ref{tbl:bca_dilutions} were
		prepared.
	\item The BCA working reaction was prepared by another group.
	\item Four tubes were prepared, each containing \SI{50}{\ul} of one of
		the dilutions and \SI{950}{\ul} of the BCA working reaction.
	\item The BCA assays were incubated for \SI{15}{\min} at \SI{37}{\celsius}
	\item A standard curve based on BSA was prepared by another group,
		according to table \ref{tbl:bca_standard}.
	\item The absorption of the dilutions and the standard curbe at
		\SI{562}{\nm} was measured. % TODO link table?
\end{itemize}

\section{Preparation of transformed pre-culture}

The following steps were performed by another group, and are listed for
completness' sake.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Pick 3 colonies from a freshly transformed plate with plasmid
		pET28a-cybB561-dsred of the given membrane protein target in
		Lemo21 (DE3) strain and inoculate \SI{15}{\ml} LB-medium
		containing \SI{35}{\ug \per \ml} of kanamycin (kan) and
		\SI{25}{\ug \per \ml} of chloramphenicol.
	\item Leave shaking overnight (ON) at \SI{37}{\celsius}. This volume is
		suitable for optimization of protein expression experiments
		(day 2)
\end{itemize}

In addition, medium according to tables \ref{tbl:medium_lb},
\ref{tbl:medium_tb_1}, \ref{tbl:medium_tb_2}, \ref{tbl:medium_auto_basis} and
\ref{tbl:medium_auto_stock} were prepared.

The LB medium was autoclaved. Part 1 of the TB medium was autoclaved, part 2
filtered. Both parts of the auto-inducing medium had their pH set to 7 with
\ce{NaOH}, the basis was then autoclaved and the stock filtered. All medium was
then set aside for the next day.

\section{Transformation of bacterial cells}

\begin{itemize}
	\item \SI{50}{\ul} of \ce{CaCl2} treated competent cells were mixed
		with \SI{1}{\ul} of pET28-cybB561 plasmids and incubated on ice
		for \SI{30}{\min}.
	\item The mixture was heat-shocked for \SI{1}{\min} at
		\SI{42}{\celsius}, then incubated on ice for \SI{5}{\min}.
	\item \SI{0.5}{\ml} LB medium, pre-warmed to \SI{37}{\celsius}, was
		added.
	\item The mixture was incubated for \SI{1}{\hour} at \SI{37}{\celsius}.
	\item The transformed bacteria were spread on a LB plate containing
		\SI{30}{\ug\per\ml} kanamycin.
	\item The plate was incubated overnight at \SI{37}{\celsius}.
	\item On the next day bacterial growth was observed on the plate,
		indicating that the transformation had been successful. The
		plate was then discarded.
\end{itemize}

\section{Expression screening of E. coli cells}

\begin{itemize}
	\item The two parts of the TB and auto-inducing medium respectively
		were mixed.
	\item Antibiotics were added to all media.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \SI{200}{\ul} kanamycin of a \SI{35}{\mg\per\ml}
				stock for a final concentration of
				\SI{35}{\ug\per\ml}.
			\item \SI{200}{\ul} chloramphenicol of a
				\SI{25}{\mg\per\ml} stock for a final
				concentration of \SI{25}{\ug\per\ml}.
		\end{itemize}
	\item \SI{1}{\ml} of each medium was set aside for use as a blank.
	\item Samples according to table \ref{tbl:expression_samples} were
		prepared.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item All samples had \SI{15}{\ml} of its corresponding
				medium, and \SI{800}{\ul} of the preculture
				added.
			\item All Rha+ samples had \SI{37.5}{\ul} of a
				\SI{0.1}{\Molar} Rhamnose stock solution added,
				for a final concentration of
				\SI{0.25}{\milli\Molar}.
		\end{itemize}
	\item Samples were incubated at \SI{37}{\celsius}, and their OD$_{600}$
		mesured every \SIrange{30}{60}{\min} until their absorbance had
		reached $0.5$.

		The measurement at \SI{90}{\min} was later found to be
		incorrect due to the cuvette having been inserted the wrong
		way.

	\item After \SI{90}{\min} all IPTG+ samples had \SI{13}{\ul} of a
		\SI{0.2}{\Molar} stock solution added.
	\item Samples were incubated at \SI{37}{\celsius} for another
		\SI{200}{\min}, and had their OD$_{600}$ measured every
		\SIrange{30}{90} minutes. The volume used to measure the
		absorbance of the LB samples was subsequently centrifuged, and
		the size and colour of the pellet observed.
	\item After \SI{290}{\min} \SI{198}{\ul} of the culture were
		solubilized with \SI{2}{\ml} of a \SI{10}{\percent} SDS stock
		solution in a 96-well plate. The fluorescence was measurd with
		a plate reader to deterine the amount of expressed protein. The
		measurements for the LB samples were redone, as they had been
		contaminated while being added to the well.

\chapter{Results}

\section{Protein concentration via BCA assay}

The measured absorption values at \SI{562}{\nm} of the prepared standard are
shown in table \ref{tbl:bca_absorption_standard}. Based on those, the device
calculated a linear regression:

\[
	\text{absorption} = 0.81542 \cdot \text{concentration} + 0.02701
\]

This allows calculating the concentration of the diluted samples based on their
absorption values, shown in table \ref{tbl:bca_absorption_sample}.

The measured absorption values of the standard and sample dilutions, as well as
their known respectively calculated concentrations, is further visualized in
figure \ref{fig:bca_absorption}.

Discarding the two measurements which fall outside the range of the standard,
and calculating the protein concentration of the undiluted sample, yields
concentrations of \SI{21.552}{\ug\per\ml} and \SI{17.342}{\ug\per\ml}
respectively. Using their average provides us with a protein concentration of
\SI{19.447}{\ug\per\ml}.

\section{Expression screening}

\subsection{OD measurements during bacterial growth}

To measure the stages of bacterial growth before and after induction, the
absorption at \SI{600}{\m} was measured in regular intervals. These results are
found in table \ref{tbl:absorption_expression}.

As mentioned in the protocol the measurement at \SI{90}{\min} was faulty, and
was thus excluded from the visualization in figure
\ref{fig:absorption_expression}.
