\section{Purification}

\subsection{Memrane solubilization}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Thaw membranes (\SI{10}{\mg\per\ml}) that you prepared on the
		first day.
	\item Create \SI{11}{\ml} dilution according to table
		\ref{tbl:membrane_dilution}
	\item Incubate mixture at \SI{4}{\celsius} for \SI{1}{\hour} while
		stirring slowly.
	\item During solubilisation, prepare buffers used for purification.
	\item Pellet the insolubilized membrane by ultracentrifugation at
		\SI{150000}{G} (Ti60-Rotor: 46000rpm) for \SI{45}{\min} at
		\SI{4}{\celsius}.
	\item Prepare HEPES wash buffer according to table
		\ref{tbl:hepes_buffer_no_ogng}, adjust pH to 7. Split in two
		\SI{250}{\ml} flasks, add \SI{10}{\percent} OGNG to one.
	\item Load \SI{2}{\ml} of Profinity beads on the column.
	\item Once ethanol is removed, add \SI{10}{\ml} (10 column volumes) of
		\SI{50}{\milli\Molar} Sodium acetate pH4,
		\SI{300}{\milli\Molar} \ce{NaCl}.
	\item Load \SI{10}{\ml} of \SI{0.2}{\Molar} Nickel (10 column volumes) 
	\item Wash the column with \SI{10}{\ml} (10 column volumes) of
		\SI{50}{\milli\Molar} Sodium acetate pH4,
		\SI{300}{\milli\Molar} \ce{NaCl}.
	\item Wash the column with \SI{15}{\ml} of MQ water
	\item Equilibrate the resin with \SI{15}{\ml} of wash buffer
		(\SI{10}{\milli\Molar} HEPES pH 7, \SI{200}{\milli\Molar}
		\ce{NaCl}, \SI{5}{\percent} glycerol and \SI{0.1}{\percent}
		OGNG. The Ni-beads are now ready to use.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Protein purification}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Prepare \SI{40}{\ml} wash buffer with \SI{5}{\milli\Molar}
		Histidine, and \SI{80}{\ml} wash buffer with
		\SI{100}{\milli\Molar} Histidine.
	\item Mix the supernatant with Ni-beads and incubate for \SI{45}{\min}
		at \SI{4}{\celsius} on a rotating wheel.
	\item Load the slurry on the column and collect the flowthrough
		(unbound proteins).
	\item Let flowthrough pass through resin 1 more time in order to bind
		remaining His-tagged protein. Keep an aliquot of \SI{12}{\ul}
		on ice. For cybB561-dsred, keep \SI{30}{\ul}.
	\item Wash the column with \SI{10}{\ml} (10 column volumes) of wash
		buffer containing OGNG. Keep an aliquot of \SI{12}{\ul} on ice.
		For cybB561-dsred, keep \SI{30}{\ul}.
	\item Wash the column with \SI{10}{\ml} (10 column volumes) of wash
		buffer \SI{5}{\milli\Molar} Histidine. Keep an aliquot of
		\SI{12}{\ul} on ice. For cybB561-dsred, keep \SI{30}{\ul}. Why
		do we wash with \SI{5}{\milli\Molar} histidine?
	\item Elute the column with \SI{20}{\ml} wash buffer +
		\SI{100}{\milli\Molar} Histidine. Keep an aliquot of
		\SI{12}{\ul} on ice. For cybB561-dsred, keep \SI{30}{\ul}.
	\item Concentrate the eluate with an Amicon \SI{10}{\kilo\Da} MWCO
		centrifugal concentrator to \SI{0.5}{\ml} (volume needed to
		inject on the size exclusion chromatography column S200
		increase).
\end{itemize}


Only for cybB561-Dsred protein, we will try to separate CybB561 and Dsred in
presence of TEV protease.

\begin{itemize}
	\item take \SI{100}{\ul} of the concentrated CybB561-Dsred and dilute
		it in \SI{10}{\ml} of \SI{10}{\milli\Molar} HEPES pH7,
		\SI{200}{\milli\Molar} \ce{NaCl}, \SI{5}{\percent} glycerol,
		\SI{0.1}{\percent} OGNG.
	\item Add \SI{200}{\ul} of TEV protease (\SI{1}{\mg\per\ml},
		M=\SI{25}{\kilo\Da}, final concentration =
		\SI{0.8}{\micro\Molar})
	\item Incubate overnight at \SI{4}{\celsius} and mix with magnetic
		stirrer.
\end{itemize}



\subsection{Size exclusion chromatography}

After purification of protein of interest using affinity chromatography, you will purify the concentrated protein again using size exclusion chromatography (gel filtration). What is the reason behind this additional step?

\begin{itemize}
	\item S200 column equilibrated overnight using wash buffer with OGNG.
	\item Fill the loop (\SI{0.5}{\ml}) on the ÄKTA pure device with the
		concentrated samples (\SI{0.5}{\ml}).
	\item Start the run. Note that fractions of eluted proteins will be
		collected automatically.
	\item Pool together fractions that you suspect to contain the protein
		of interest.
	\item Concentrate with an Amicon \SI{10}{\kilo\Da} MWCO centrifugal
		concentrator (final volume that can be reached is
		\SI{250}{\ul}).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Reverse IMAC}

While running a gel filtration, you will do a reverse IMAC with cybB561.Dsred
cleaved overnight using TEV protease as follows:

\begin{itemize}
	\item First, take a sample of \SI{30}{\ul}, keep on ice.
	\item Load the mixture on the column (containing pre-equilibrated resin
		charged again with nickel).
	\item Retain the flow-through. Keep an aliquot of \SI{30}{\ul} on ice.
		Flowthrough was kept as it contained the cleaved HS. The
		flowthrough was light red, the beads not red.
	\item Load elution buffer on the column (the same that you used a day
		before). Keep an aliquot of \SI{30}{\ul} on ice. The elution
		was pink.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Protein concentration determination}

To determine the concentration of the different purified proteins, we will take
advantage of the absorbance of the 2 hemes that are buried inside the protein.

\begin{itemize}
	\item A buffer \SI{20}{\milli\Molar} HEPES pH7.4, \SI{20}{\milli\Molar}
		\ce{KCl} \SI{200}{\milli\Molar} \ce{NaCl}, \SI{0.05}{\percent}
		DDM was prepared.
	\item A cuvette was filled with \SI{748}{\ul} buffer and the baseline measured by scanning between \SI{600}{\nm} and \SI{400}{\nm}.
	\item \SI{2}{\ul} of protein were added and measured again.
	\item A small amount of sodium dithionite was added to fully reduce the
		protein, and another measurement done.
	\item The original protein concentration was calculated using the
		dilution factor, baseline-compensanted \SI{561}{\nm} absorbance
		difference of oxidized and reduced form, path length of
		\SI{1}{\c} and and extinction coefficient of
		\SI{46.36}{\per\milli\Molar\per\cm}.
	\item Proteins were frozen in liquid nitrogen in small droplets, and
		stored at \SI{-80}{\celsius}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{SDS-PAGE}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Two gels were prepared according to the recipe (\SI{12}{\percent}).
	\item Samples were prepared according to table \ref{tbl:sds_samples}.
	\item Samples were incubated for \SI{30}{\min} at \SI{40}{\celsius}
	\item \SI{10}{\ul} of sample were loaded per lane, with \SI{5}{\ul} ruler in empty lanes.
	\item The gel was run for \SI{20}{\min} at \SI{125}{\V}, followed by \SI{80}{\min} at \SI{185}{\V}.
	\item The gel was coomassie-stained, and cleaned overnight.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Fluorescence measurements}

The efficiency of each purification step can be determined by the measurement
of fluorescence of the different samples that were taken in different steps of
purification (this can only be done for cybB561-dsred).

\begin{itemize}
	\item \SI{15}{\ul} of each sample were diluted to \SI{200}{\ul} with
		dd\ce{H2O}.
	\item Diluated samples were loaded onto a 96-well plate.
	\item Fluorescence was measured at an emission of \SI{586}{\nm},
		extinction of \SI{555}{\nm}
\end{itemize}
