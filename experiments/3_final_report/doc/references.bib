	abstract = {Optimising membrane protein production yields in Escherichia coli can be time- and resource-consuming. Here, we present a simple and effective Membrane protein Single shot amplification recipe: MemStar. This one-shot amplification recipe is based on the E. coli strain Lemo21(DE3), the PASM-5052 auto-induction medium and, contradictorily, an IPTG induction step. Using MemStar, production yields for most bacterial membrane proteins tested were improved to reach an average of 5 mg L−1 per OD600 unit, which is significantly higher than yields obtained with other common production strategies. With MemStar, we have been able to obtain new structural information for several transporters, including the sodium/proton antiporter NapA.},

	abstract={Superoxide is a reactive oxygen species produced during aerobic metabolism in mitochondria and prokaryotes. It causes damage to lipids, proteins and DNA and is implicated in cancer, cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative disorders and aging. As protection, cells express soluble superoxide dismutases, disproportionating superoxide to oxygen and hydrogen peroxide. Here, we describe a membrane-bound enzyme that directly oxidizes superoxide and funnels the sequestered electrons to ubiquinone in a diffusion-limited reaction. Experiments in proteoliposomes and inverted membranes show that the protein is capable of efficiently quenching superoxide generated at the membrane in vitro. The 2.0 {\AA} crystal structure shows an integral membrane di-heme cytochrome b poised for electron transfer from the P-side and proton uptake from the N-side. This suggests that the reaction is electrogenic and contributes to the membrane potential while also conserving energy by reducing the quinone pool. Based on this enzymatic activity, we propose that the enzyme family be denoted superoxide oxidase (SOO).},

	abstract={Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated within cells or, more generally, in a tissue environment, may easily turn into a source of cell and tissue injury. Aerobic organisms have developed evolutionarily conserved mechanisms and strategies to carefully control the generation of ROS and other oxidative stress-related radical or non-radical reactive intermediates (that is, to maintain redox homeostasis), as well as to 'make use' of these molecules under physiological conditions as tools to modulate signal transduction, gene expression and cellular functional responses (that is, redox signalling). However, a derangement in redox homeostasis, resulting in sustained levels of oxidative stress and related mediators, can play a significant role in the pathogenesis of major human diseases characterized by chronic inflammation, chronic activation of wound healing and tissue fibrogenesis. This review has been designed to first offer a critical introduction to current knowledge in the field of redox research in order to introduce readers to the complexity of redox signalling and redox homeostasis. This will include ready-to-use key information and concepts on ROS, free radicals and oxidative stress-related reactive intermediates and reactions, sources of ROS in mammalian cells and tissues, antioxidant defences, redox sensors and, more generally, the major principles of redox signalling and redox-dependent transcriptional regulation of mammalian cells. This information will serve as a basis of knowledge to introduce the role of ROS and other oxidative stress-related intermediates in contributing to essential events, such as the induction of cell death, the perpetuation of chronic inflammatory responses, fibrogenesis and much more, with a major focus on hepatic chronic wound healing and liver fibrogenesis.},

abstract = "The coral red fluorescent protein (DsRed) absorbs and emits light at much higher wavelengths than the structurally homologous green fluorescent protein, raising questions about the properties of its chromophore. We have analyzed the relationship between the aggregation state and fluorescence of native, 6-histidine-tagged, or maltose-binding protein-fused DsRed. In all cases, newly synthesized DsRed molecules were largely monomeric and devoid of covalently closed chromophores. Maturation in vitro induces the expression of red fluorescent chromophores but only in oligomeric forms of the protein, whereas monomers are essentially devoid of fluorescence. NaOH-denatured samples demonstrated a generalized breakdown of the DsRed oligomers to monomers, which refolded after neutralization into weakly green fluorescent and still monomeric species. Red fluorescent chromophores were regenerated only upon oligomerization. These findings demonstrate that ‘red’ chromophores form and are functional only as oligomers, and suggest that the smallest red fluorescent functional unit is a dimer. A comparison of alkali-, acid- and guanidinium-denatured DsRed indicates that stabilization of the DsRed chromophore by concerted steps of folding and oligomerization may play a critical role in its maturation process."
