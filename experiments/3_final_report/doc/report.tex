\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
	Three variants of superoxide oxidase were grown in bacterial BL21 cells
	and purified using size-exclusion and affinity chromatography.
	Purification efficiency was monitored using fluorescence of
	dsRed-tagged proteins.

	Purified enzymes were reconstituted into liposomes using freeze-thaw
	cycles. Reconstituted and solubilzed enzymes were then analyzed,
	measuring their reduction in presence of superoxide or quinone, as well
	as enzymatic activity using absorbance measurements.

	Using the collected data the enzymes were characterized, estimating
	their $K_m$ value as well as gaining insights into the orientation of
	enzymes in liposomes.

\part*{Introduction}

Reactive oxygen species (`ROS') such as superoxide (\ce{O2-}) or hydrogen
peroxide (\ce{H2O2}) are toxic to the body, causing damage to proteins or DNA,
with links to various diseases including cancer. As such organisms under
aerobic conditions counteract ROS via eg Superoxide Dismutase (`SOD') which
catalyzes the partitioning of superoxide into molecular oxygen and hydrogen
peroxide.

One major source of superoxide is the oxidative phosphoryliation within the
mitochondrial matrix. \cite{Novo2008} To a lesser extent these superoxides
diffuse into the cytoplasm, where they are acted upon by SOD. A significant
portion of superoxides however is oxidised by superoxide oxidases - henceafter
referred to as `SOO' or `Halonsaft' due to its colour - a family of
membrane-bound proteins which oxidize superoxides.\cite{superoxide_salvaging}.

One protein of this family is CybB from E. Coli which was shown to function as
a superoxide:ubiquinone oxidoreductase. It oxidizes superoxide to oxygen while
simultaneously reducing quinone to quinol.\cite{superoxide_salvaging} This
enzymatic activity both serves to remove superoxides in close proximity to the
cell membrane, as well as restore the quinone pool, helping to save energy.
