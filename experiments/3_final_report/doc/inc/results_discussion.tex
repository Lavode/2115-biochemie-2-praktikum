\part{Results \& discussion}

\section{Transformation}

The goal of bacterial transformation was to get competent E. Coli cells of the
LEMO21 (DE3) strain to take up pET28a-cybB561 plasmids, allowing for the
selective overexpression of HS in presence of lactose or IPTG. Rhamnose allowed
to selectively inhibit the T7 polymerase translating the HS gene.
\cite{memstar} To permit selection the plasmid further encodes for a resistance
to kanamycin.

The overnight incubated plates containing kanamycin had multiple colonies
growing on them the next day. This showed that the heat shock treatment had
been successful. Transformed colonies were not used further due to time
constraints, rather expression was monitored simultaneously with
pre-transformed starting culture.

\section{Expression}

Note that bacteria resulting from this step were not used further due to time
constraint. Rather purification happened simultaneously, with a provided
bacterial pellet.

\subsection{Expression monitoring}

During expression the efficiency of several media was to be established, both
in terms of speed of cell growth as well as yield of HS per cell. Three
different types of medium (LB, TB, ZYM-505) were prepared, with four samples
each.

Increasing the amount of produced proteins per cell was of interest as it
lowers the amount of detergent required to solublize the cell membranes.

Protein expression was monitored by measurement of \odbact of incubating
samples, visualized in figure \ref{fig:absorption_expression}. A mesurement at
\SI{90}{\min} was excluded as it had been done incorrectly. IPTG was added at
\SI{90}{\min}.

It was shown that cells grew faster in TB and ZYM-505 medium than in LB medium,
as seen by the slope of the curve as well as final \odbact reached. This was
likely caused by the higher concentration of nutrients such as yeast extract
and tryptone in the case of TB, respectively additional glucose and lactose in
the case of ZYM-505.

It was further shown that samples not containing IPTG followed the normal
growth pattern of bacterial cells, starting in a lag phase of little cell
growth, a log phase of exponential cell growth - shown as a lineare incrase of
\odbact - and the beginnings of a stationary phase where cell growth cedes. The
absence of IPTG will have prevented overexpression of HS, allowing cells to
grow as normal.

Cells treated with IPTG at \SI{90}{\min} and not containing Rhamnose showed
stagnation of cell growth indicative of overexpression of HS. Cells treated
with IPTG and containing Rhamnose did not show any sign of overexpression of
HS.

\subsection{Expression efficiency}

After expression the amount of expressed HS-Dsred was measured via fluorescence
measurements. Results were normalized to cell density, giving an approximation
of protein concentration per cell. Such normalized results are are shown in
figure \ref{fig:fluorescence_expression}.

\subsubsection{Base protein expression}

Overall protein expression per cell can be estimated using IPTG-negative
samples. It was shown that LB and ZYM-505 media produce comparable amounts of
proteins per cell, while the amount of proteins per cell in the TB medium was
significantly higher. This conflicts with the memstar paper which found that
protein production normalized to cell density was only slightly higher in TB
compared to the other two media. \cite{memstar}

It is possible that the cell density of the TB samples was underestimated, as
the linear relation between \odbact and cell density only holds for low values
of \odbact, as well as the spectrophotometer being less accurate for values
exceeding $1$.

\subsubsection{HS-Dsred expression}

Comparing the normalized fluorescence of IPTG-positive, Rhamnose-negative
samples with other samples in the same media showed that addition of IPTG
increased the amount of proteins - specifically HS-Dsred - which was expressed
per cell.

\subsubsection{Limiting HS-Dsred expression with Rhamnose}

Addition of Rhamnose to samples was supposed to limit the overexpression of
HS-Dsred, preventing a coplete stagnation of cell growth as well as the
potential buildup of inclusion bodies. \cite{memstar}.

As Rhamnose-positive samples did not show any sign of HS-Dsred expression, with
fluorescence levels comparable to IPTG-negative samples, we conclude that
either too much Rhamnose was added such that the T7 polymerase was inhibited
fully, or that no IPTG had been added to those samples.

\section{Purification}

\subsection{Membrane protein concentration}

Concentration of harvested membrane proteins was determined in a BCA assay by
comparison with a known standard. Absorption at \SI{562}{\nm} of the standard
was measured and a linear regression calculated as $\text{absorption} = 0.81542
\cdot \text{concentration} + 0.02701$. Measured absorptions and calculated
concentrations of a dilution of membrae proteins are shown in table
\ref{tbl:bca_absorption_sample}.

Measurements with absorption values outside the standard's range of 0.0053 to
1.6353 were discarded, which resulted in an average protein concentration of
\SI{22.86 \pm 3.20}{\mg\per\ml}.

\subsection{Purified protein concentration}

Protein concentration was determined using the absorbance of the two hemes at
\SI{561}{\nm} as described. Measurement values between \SIrange{400}{600}{\nm}
are shown in figure \ref{fig:hs_concentration}.

A baseline was established by calculating the average absorption difference of
reduced and oxidized form between \SIrange{580}{600}{\nm}. The absorption
difference at \SI{561}{\nm} was calculated and the baseeline difference added.

Given the path length of the cuvette as \SI{1}{\cm}, a dilution factor of 375
and an extinction coefficient of \SI{46.36}{\per\milli\Molar\per\cm} the
protein concentration was calculated using Beer's law. Such calculated
concentrations are shown in table \ref{tbl:hs_concentration}.

\subsection{SDS PAGE}

Purification steps were checked with an SDS page, results shown in figure
\ref{fig:sds}.

\subsubsection{Wildtype \& mutant}

Cyan marks HS, with an expected molecular weight of
\SI{24}{\kilo\Da}\cite{pdb}. As was expected it was highly concentrated after
the \ce{Ni} bead chromatography, and remained so after the ÄKTA SEC.
Furthermore it can be seen in small quantities in the \SI{5}{\milli\Molar} His
wash implying that a small amount was lost when washing the column. As the band
of the after-ÄKTA steps seems smaller than the one preceding it it is assumed
that some was also lost during the SEC.

\subsubsection{Dsred}

Green marks the HS-Dsred pair, with a combined expected weight of
\SI{49}{\kilo\Da} \cite{pdb}. It takes the place of plain HS in the samples of
the wildtype and mutant. After TEV cleavage - that is from the `before loading'
colum on onwards - there is no band at this height anymore, which shows that
cleavage was successful. After cleavage the solo HS is marked in cyan, near its
expected size of \SI{24}{\kilo\Da}. Of interest are faint bands on the same
height in the samples before cleavage, which might imply that a small amount of
HS-Dsred had been cleaved before. In the reverse IMAC it was mostly found in
the flowthrough, as the His tag is on the Dsred. Small amounts can be seen in
the elution, implying that an intermediary wash step might have been required.

Red marks Dsred with its molecular weight of \SI{25}{\kilo\Da}, further
identified by being on the same height as the pure Dsred loaded in the last
lane. It is mostly visible in the elution after cleavage, as its His tag
allowed binding to the column, with tiny amounts visible in the flowthrough. Of
interest once more are the corresponding bands in the lanes before cleavage,
seeming to imply that it undergoes cleavage even in the absence of
TEV-protease.

Dark grey marks the TEV protease with a molecular weight of
\SIrange{25}{27}{\kilo\Da} \cite{pdb}. It was found in the sample taken after
cleavage, as well as the elute of the column due to its His tag. It was not
found in the flowthrough, as its His tag allowed it to bind to the column.

Yellow finally marks what seems to be a dimer of Dsred around
\SI{50}{\kilo\Da}. It can be seen in nearly all lanes where Dsred itself is
found.

\subsection{Purification efficiency}

Fluorescence values of HS-Dsred samples, from aliquots taken during various
steps of the purification, scaled to sample volume, are shown in figure
\ref{fig:purification_fluorescence}. They allowed the tracking of losses during
purification steps.

Measurements showed that the breakage of cells in the maximator did not incur
significant losses. Membrane extraction via ultracentrifugation caused
significant losses of protein, as potentially not all membrane proteins had
been pelleted, or parts of the pellets were lost.

Comparison of fluorescence before the \ce{Ni} beads affinity chromatography
(`Membranes') with the one after (`\ce{Ni} beads elution') imply that not a lot
of proteins were lost during affinity chromatography, with the majority of
losses being in the column flowthrough, implying that too much protein was
loaded onto the column at once.

Measurements of the reverse IMAC finally confirmed that most of the His-tagged
Dsred which was loaded was able to bind to the column, and was hence found in
the elution.

\section{Characterization}

The final part of the experiment had the goal to measure relative enzyme
reduction in presence of quinol and superoxide, as well as enzyme activity in a
system containing both.

\subsection{Relative enzyme reduction in presence of quinol \& superoxide}

Absorption measurements of HS as shown in figure \ref{fig:reduction_quinol} and
\ref{fig:reduction_superox} were used to determine the relative reduction
rate of HS in presence of quinol or superoxide. A baseline was established
using the average absorption between \SIrange{0.8}{0.9}{\min}. Reduction caused
by presence of either substrate was determined using the absorption between
\SIrange{2.5}{2.6}{\min}, and full reduction by DTT was determined using
absorption between \SIrange{3.9}{4}{\min}.

% 		\bottomrule
% 	\end{tabu}
% 	\caption{Relative reduction of HS by quinol addition}
% 	\label{tbl:reduction_quinol}
% \end{table}
Relative reduction rates were calculated as described, visualized in figures
\ref{fig:reduction_quinol_relative} and \ref{fig:reduction_superox_relative}. 

It was shown that reduction of HS requires presence of quinol or superoxide, as
DTT was unable to reduce HS directly in the negative control. Further it was
shown that superoxide dismutase is able to effectively quench reduction of
superoxide by disproprotionating superoxide to molecular oxygen and hydrogen
peroxide.


\subsubsection{Wildtype vs mutant}

The data showed no significant difference in relative reduction between
wildtype and mutant was shown. This implies that the mutation has no effect on
the enzyme activity if sufficient substrate is present. The mutation might have an
effect on the affinity of the enzyme, as was shown later.

\subsubsection{Quinol as substrate}

Relative reduction of reconstituted HS was shown to be close to the theoretical
maximum of \SI{50}{\percent}, as only one of the two Hemes can be reduced by
quinol. Relative reduction of solubilized HS was shown to be lower than that of
reconstituted enzymes. This might have been the result of experimental error,
or quinol has an easier time binding to reconstituted enzymes due to their
proximity to the polar outer layer of liposomes.

\subsubsection{Superoxide as substrate}

The data shows that the relative reduction of solubilized enzymes by superoxide
is significantly higher than those of reconstituted enzymes. This might imply
that superoxide is unable to enter liposomes, such that in the case of
liposomes it cannot reduce those HS enzymes whose superoxide-oxidating site is
within the liposome. Such an observation was also made in the one of the
referenced papers \cite{superoxide_salvaging}. If this holds then the ratio of
HS oriented such that the superoxide-oxidating end is on the outside of the
liposomes can be estimated to be about half the total amount of reconstituted
HS.

\subsection{Fluorescence before and after TEV cleavage of reconstituted enzymes}

To control whether overnight TEV-cleavage was sucessful, fluorescence of cleaved
and uncleaved reconstituted samples was measured. Furthermore the ability to
quench and restore fluorescence via addition of \ce{Cu^{2+}} and EDTA
respectively was investigated. Collected data is shown in figure
\ref{fig:dsred_cleavage_fluorescence}.

The sample with solubilized measurement showed that the method of quenching
Dsred fluorescence with copper, and restoring it via addition of the chelating
agent EDTA, works

It was shown that fluorescence of uncleaved liposomes was able to be quenched
similarly, with nearly complete quenching for sufficiently high copper
concentrations in relation to liposome concentration. This implies that the
liposome contained HS-Dsred orientated such that Dsred is on the outside of the
liposomes, where copper was able to reach it. The not quite complete quenching
implies that either not enough copper had been added, or that some HS-Dsred was
oriented such that its Dsred is on the inside of the liposome. Further
experiments with ncreased copper concentration would be needed to bring
clarity.

	\caption{Fluorescence and quenching thereof of cleaved and uncleaved reconstituted liposomes with cyb561-Dsred}
	\label{fig:dsred_cleavage_fluorescence}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Enzyme activity}

In order to determine enzymatic activity an assay containing a source of
superoxide (xanthine oxidase and hypoxanthine), a source of quinone (quinone
and BO3 oxidase), and WST-1 dye to measure superoxide concentration via
absorption measurement at \SI{455}{\nm} was used.

In a first step, sufficient HS concentration to quench superoxide production as
efficiently as SOD was determined, which was \SI{4.764}{\micro\Molar} for the
mutant, \SI{0.496}{\micro\Molar} for the wild type.

In a second step the concentration of superoxide via WST-1 reduction was
observed. As before the system was prepared and measurements started. XO and HS
were added with a delay, three slopes were measured:

\begin{itemize}
	\item $s_{\text{HS}}$: Slope after HS addition
	\item $s_{\text{XO}}$: Average slope after XO addition
	\item $s_{\text{SOD}}$: Slope after SOD addition
\end{itemize}

This allowed calculating the relative superoxide production as
$\text{SO}_{\text{rel}} := \frac{s_{\text{HS}}}{s_{\text{XO}} -
s_{\text{SOD}}}$ , and relative reduction of superoxide - corresponding to
enzymatic activity - as  $\text{HS-Activity}_{\text{rel}} := 1 -
\text{SO}_{\text{rel}}$. Such results in a linear as well as double-reciprocal
Lineweaver-Burke plot are shown in figure \ref{fig:activity}.

A linear regresion $y = a \cdot x + b$ was performed on the Lineweaver-Burke
plot. Using those parameters the maximum reaction velocity and $K_m$ were
determined as $v_\text{max} := b^{-1}$, $K_m := v_\text{max} \cdot a$.
Calculated values are shown in table \ref{tbl:activity_km}. It was shown that
the $K_m$ of the mutant was two two three orders of magnitude lower than that
of the wildtype, implying that the mutation either lowered the affinity of the
enzyme for its substrate, or decreased the speed at which they are processed.
